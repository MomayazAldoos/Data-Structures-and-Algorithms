Here i will disccuse the correctness of algorithms.

First of all, Instance: An instance of a problem consist of the input that nedded to compute a solution to the problem. 

We say that an algorithm is correct if for every input instance it halts (terminates) with the correct outputwhich leads to that the algorithm solves the problem. ÃŸ
