Insertion Sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that organizes an array of elements into ascending order. It iterates through the array using a single loop, incrementally building a sorted subarray by inserting each element into its correct position.

 **Use Case: Effective for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays due to its adaptive nature

 Time complexity: O(n)
 Space Complexity: O(1) as it sort in-place
